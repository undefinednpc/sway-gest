**Utility to enable workspace switching with touchpad gestures in Sway.**

Touchpad gestures are supposed to be included in Sway 1.7 (pull request [here](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/pull/4952)).

I thought this could be fun project anyways, to practice C. I will probably archive it once gestures are official.
